NOTES

    #Image for Ubuntu 22.04 Jammmy has issue with apt-keys/gpg/signatures/public_key which prevents apt & apt-get from running correctly, crashing the build. Apparently using a newer version of Docker may solve this, however I happen to be on Win7 on BlackBox, which runs the latest version of the deprecated docker-toolbox. Will have to  boot into Win10 or Pop! OS or use the laptop to test the solution =(.

    execute command in container == docker exec -it foo_container command

    build container from compose == docker build . --file docker-compose.yml
